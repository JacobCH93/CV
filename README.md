## Jacob Hanrahan

I'm a London born, work focused, problem solving person with a curious background. Before this I spent 10 years working in hospitlaity, 4 of which were as a manager. Funnily enough, much of my work was based on problem solving (this tables food is running late, the delivery is missing items, etc.) which transfers pefectly over to coding. Because in essence thats what it is, finding a solution to a problem and how to achieve it. Added to that I am completly addicted to coding.

## Skills

#### Adaptive
I learn new skills very quickly, although mastering them of course takes time. I move into new teams quickly and work well both leading a team and being part of a team.

#### Creativity
As a coder of any kind you need to think outside of the box. I think in ways that focus on the solution and then lay out the steps to achieve it.

#### Enthusiasm
You will very rarely catch me without a smile on my face. I want to learn. I want to push. And I want everyone to feel like they have achived something by the end of the day. 

#### Interpesonal Management
I have 4 years expience managing people. I would solve any problem given by the satff efficiently and affectivly. If there were problems between the staff members I would take an open aproach and try to come up with an ammpicable soultion. This ensured a safe and happy and work environment and produced healthy profits for the company. Always invest in staff members, no matter how small their roll.

#### Stock Control
By the end of my fouth year managing I had moved to a large club/bar with a 1000 people capacity. It was my respsibility to order in the stock and keep track of how it was used. In order to this I needed to take stock every week of thousands of  units of product that would be around Â£30,000 cost price. Where there were shorfalls and surpluses I would need to find the reason and correct it the following week.

#### Work Mentality
Of course I like my down time. But I confess I am a bit of a workaholic. From 120 hour weeks to 3 jobs at once, I never back down from a challenge and only finish when the job is done.
