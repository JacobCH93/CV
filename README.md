Born and raised in London, and coding sparked my curiostiy. Previously I worked for 10 years in hospitlaity, 4 of which were as a manager. Funnily enough, much of my work was based on problem solving (this tables food is running late, the delivery is missing items, etc.) which transfers pefectly over to coding. Using creativity to find the most efficent solution.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Adaptive
I learn new skills very quickly, although mastering them of course takes time. I move into new teams quickly and work well both leading a team and being part of a team.

#### Creativity
As a coder of any kind you need to think outside of the box. I think in ways that focus on the solution and then lay out the steps to achieve it.

#### Enthusiasm
You will very rarely catch me without a smile on my face. I want to learn. I want to push. And I want everyone to feel like they have achived something by the end of the day. 

#### Interpesonal Management
I have 4 years expience managing people. I would solve any problem given by the satff efficiently and affectivly. This ensured a safe and happy and work environment and produced healthy profits for the company. Always invest in staff members, no matter how small their roll.

#### Stock Control
By the end of my fouth year managing I had moved to a large club/bar with a 1000 people capacity. It was my respsibility to order in the stock and keep track of around Â£30,000 cost price alcohol. Where there were shortfalls and surpluses I would need to find the reason and correct it for the following week.

#### Work Mentality
Of course I like my down time. But I confess I am a bit of a workaholic. From 120 hour weeks to 3 jobs at once, I never back down from a challenge and only finish when the job is done.
